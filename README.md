# Development Status

Unfortunately, a lack of backwards compatilibity in the newer Solid specs, has lead to many solid servers not working with this code base.

Therefore, continued development on this repo is paused indefinitely.

It is still, however, a goal to explore social bookmarking, taking into account newer innovation.
